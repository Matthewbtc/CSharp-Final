C# and JavaScript are actually pretty different, not only in the way you "speak" it, but in the way
that things work throughout the system. In JavaScript when you want to write in the "class", you 
just write in the script. Writing in the script automatically means youre writting in the class. However,
in C# you have to declare a class in order to make one. Another thing that is a default difference is that
anything you type in JavaScript is defaulted as public, while in C# the code is defaulted as private and
must be declared as public to become visable. Other variations are orders of objects called and names of
things being declared.
